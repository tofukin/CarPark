/**
 * Vehicle is an abstract class specifying the basic state of a vehicle and the methods used to 
 * set and access that state. A vehicle is created upon arrival, at which point it must either 
 * enter the car park to take a vacant space or become part of the queue. If the queue is full, then 
 * the vehicle must leave and never enters the car park. The vehicle cannot be both parked and queued 
 * at once and both the constructor and the parking and queuing state transition methods must 
 * respect this constraint. 
 * 
 * Vehicles are created in a neutral state. If the vehicle is unable to park or queue, then no changes 
 * are needed if the vehicle leaves the carpark immediately.
 * Vehicles that remain and can't park enter a queued state via {@link #enterQueuedState() enterQueuedState} 
 * and leave the queued state via {@link #exitQueuedState(int) exitQueuedState}. 
 * Note that an exception is thrown if an attempt is made to join a queue when the vehicle is already 
 * in the queued state, or to leave a queue when it is not. 
 * 
 * Vehicles are parked using the {@link #enterParkedState(int, int) enterParkedState} method and depart using 
 * {@link #exitParkedState(int) exitParkedState}
 * 
 * Note again that exceptions are thrown if the state is inappropriate: vehicles cannot be parked or exit 
 * the car park from a queued state. 
 * 
 * The method javadoc below indicates the constraints on the time and other parameters. Other time parameters may 
 * vary from simulation to simulation and so are not constrained here.
